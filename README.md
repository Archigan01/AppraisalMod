# Appraisal Mod

Appraisal Mod is a Terraria mod aimed to be a sizeable content mod with the end goal of expanding heavily on the lore of the base game. We are slowly but surely making progress, currently reaching the point of early game into mid-preHM.

## Installation

Download the `.tmod` file to your `My Games/Terraria/tModLoader/Mods` directory directly. It should show up in your mod list.

## Roadmap

v0.11.1 is the latest release, v0.12 is in the works and trucking along now that we have a spriter. It will introduce a lot more progression and ores through mid pre-hardmode, and come with some sprite refreshes.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.
