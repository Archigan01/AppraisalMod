Appraisal Mod is an ongoing project (has been for too long) with me and some others. After a large hiatus, I have decided to come back and revive this old project of mine, starting with the Mystic Scholar and going from there.

Changelog can be found in my Discord server (discord.gg/3WQeea9) in #changelog. Bear in mind as I have to finish setting up the Discord server.

Yes, the changelog is based entirely off of Calamity Mod's. No, I do not care.

I am accepting applications for any position (dev, spriter, or music producer) to help in any way with this mod.

Dev applications are now in a google form! If you want easy access to the form, join my Discord server above and click the link in #development-applications.
